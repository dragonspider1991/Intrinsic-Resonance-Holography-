# IRH v16.0 - Phase 2 Kickoff Status

**Date**: December 10, 2025  
**Phase**: 2 - Exascale Infrastructure & Certified Scaling  
**Status**: In Progress (kickoff underway)

---

## Scope & Required Manuscripts

Phase 2 begins the exascale build-out and must reference both foundational texts during every milestone:

- `docs/manuscripts/IRHv16.md`
- `docs/manuscripts/IRHv16_Supplementary_Vol_1-5.md`

---

## Initial Objectives

- Stand up distributed AHS/CRN interfaces (MPI-ready skeleton)
- Integrate multi-fidelity NCD with certified error budgets
- Enable Harmony Functional evaluation on distributed CRNs
- Scale ARO optimizer with checkpointing for cluster runs

---

## Milestone Checklist

- [ ] Confirm manuscript alignment for Phase 2 scope (IRHv16.md + Supplementary Vol 1-5)
- [ ] Implement distributed AHS/CRN baseline (CPU)
- [ ] Add multi-fidelity NCD pipeline with certified precision
- [ ] Wire Harmony Functional into distributed CRN path
- [ ] Scale ARO optimizer with persistence and monitoring
- [ ] Add Phase 2 regression tests and documentation updates

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Cross-reference requirements with both manuscripts (IRHv16.md and IRHv16_Supplementary_Vol_1-5.md).
2. Update implementation roadmap tasks for Phase 2 to include distributed targets and error budgets.
3. Define minimal test harness for distributed AHS/CRN components.
