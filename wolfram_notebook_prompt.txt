PROMPT FOR LLM-ENABLED WOLFRAM NOTEBOOK
================================================================================

I am working with the Intrinsic Resonance Holography (IRH) theoretical physics
framework. Please generate Mathematica code to implement the GTEC (Graph 
Topological Emergent Complexity) kernel with the following specifications:

TASK:
Generate a complete Mathematica notebook that:

1. Creates a random symmetric graph adjacency matrix of size N×N (N=1000)
   - Use sparse matrix representation for efficiency
   - Connection probability ~10%

2. Computes the graph Laplacian: L = D - A
   where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix

3. Performs eigenvalue decomposition of the Laplacian
   - Compute all eigenvalues and eigenvectors
   - Sort by eigenvalue magnitude

4. Computes entanglement entropy for a bipartite partition
   - Use the ground state (eigenvector with smallest eigenvalue)
   - Compute von Neumann entropy: S = -Tr(ρ log₂ ρ)
   - For a partition A|B where |A| = N/2

5. Calculates GTEC energy contribution
   - GTEC coupling: μ = 1/(N ln N)
   - GTEC energy: E_GTEC = -μ * S

6. Visualizes results:
   - Histogram of eigenvalue distribution
   - Plot of entropy vs partition size
   - 3D visualization of Laplacian spectrum

7. Exports results to JSON format

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use efficient numerical methods (SparseArray, Eigenvalues optimization)
- Include progress indicators for long computations
- Add clear section headers and documentation
- Make it reproducible with SeedRandom[42]
- Include error handling for numerical instabilities

PHYSICS CONTEXT:
The GTEC mechanism provides negative vacuum energy that cancels the large
positive QFT vacuum energy, explaining the small observed cosmological constant.
This is a key prediction of IRH theory.

Please generate the complete, executable Mathematica code now.
