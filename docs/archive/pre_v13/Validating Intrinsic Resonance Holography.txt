Comprehensive Computational Framework for the Empirical Validation of Intrinsic Resonance Holography
1. Theoretical Foundations and Empirical Imperatives
The contemporary landscape of gravitational physics is defined by a stark dichotomy: the unparalleled predictive success of General Relativity (GR) in the weak and strong-field regimes, and its persistent theoretical incompleteness when confronted with the principles of quantum mechanics. This tension has catalyzed the development of alternative frameworks, among which Intrinsic Resonance Holography (IRH) stands as a particularly rigorous candidate for empirical falsification. IRH posits that the spacetime continuum is not a fundamental entity but an emergent projection from a boundary theory, characterized by specific, scale-dependent corrections. Unlike the idealized anti-de Sitter (AdS) constructions of string theory, IRH predicts that the holographic nature of spacetime manifests as "resonances"—discrete spectral features and phase shifts—observable at the event horizons of black holes, in the propagation of gravitational waves over cosmological distances, and in the vacuum energy density governing cosmic expansion.
Validating such a framework requires a departure from standard phenomenological testing, which typically seeks generic deviations from the Einstein-Hilbert action. Instead, the verification of IRH demands a targeted, multi-messenger interrogation of observational data to detect the specific "fingerprints" of holographic granularity: the "ringing" of the horizon membrane, the "leakage" of gravitational strain into bulk dimensions, and the "saturation" of entropy bounds at the cosmic scale. This report establishes an exhaustive computational protocol for this task. It synthesizes high-fidelity data products from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) numerical relativity catalog, the Pantheon+ supernova survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Planck satellite, and the KATRIN neutrino experiment.
The analysis presented herein is not merely a theoretical exercise; it is a technical manual for the construction of a unified Global Likelihood Framework. By integrating these diverse datasets into a single Bayesian inference engine—specifically the Cobaya architecture—researchers can quantify the statistical evidence for IRH against the standard \LambdaCDM + GR baseline. The following sections detail the acquisition, processing, and statistical modeling of each required dataset, defining a rigorous pathway from raw archival files to posterior probability distributions.
1.1 The Necessity of Likelihood-Level Analysis
A critical methodological premise of this framework is the rejection of summary statistics in favor of full likelihood analysis. In the era of precision cosmology, the use of derived parameters (such as H_0 = 73 \pm 1 km/s/Mpc) is fraught with risk when testing non-standard theories. These summary values are often obtained by marginalizing over nuisance parameters assuming a specific underlying model (usually standard GR). If IRH introduces correlations between parameters that are absent in GR—for example, a coupling between the graviton mass and the local dark energy density—standard summary statistics will bias the result, potentially masking a true signal or creating a false tension.
Therefore, this protocol mandates the ingestion of raw posterior chains, full covariance matrices, and residual time-series data. We utilize the Cobaya framework to perform importance sampling and direct MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) exploration of the IRH parameter space. This allows the data to speak directly to the holographic hypothesis without the interpretive filter of General Relativity. The specific files required for this "deep dive" analysis, including sys_full_long.txt for supernovae and IGWN-GWTC3-TGR-v1-liv.tar.gz for gravitational waves, represent the foundational bedrock of this empirical strategy.
2. Gravitational Wave Interferometry: Probing the Horizon and Propagation
The most immediate and distinct signatures of Intrinsic Resonance Holography are expected to appear in the gravitational wave sector. The theory predicts that the event horizon is a structured, resonant membrane rather than a mere coordinate singularity, and that the graviton itself may acquire an effective mass or dispersive character due to interactions with the holographic boundary. The Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) serves as the primary laboratory for these tests.
2.1 The GWTC-3 Testing General Relativity Data Release
The LVK collaboration has provided a comprehensive suite of data products derived from the confident events observed during the O3b observing run. These files, accessible via the LIGO Document Control Center (DCC) and mirrored on Zenodo, contain the raw posterior samples for numerous tests of GR. For the specific requirements of IRH validation, four distinct data archives are essential.

	2.2 Testing the Holographic Dispersion Relation
Standard General Relativity requires that gravitational waves propagate strictly at the speed of light (c), implying a dispersion relation E = pc. IRH, however, suggests that the "bulk" spacetime is emergent and that gravitational waves may interact with the underlying holographic screen, leading to a modified dispersion relation (MDR) of the form:
Here, A represents the amplitude of the holographic correction, and \alpha is a phenomenological parameter related to the fractal dimension of the boundary theory. If \alpha \neq 0, the group velocity of gravitational waves becomes frequency-dependent, causing a "de-phasing" of the signal as it propagates from the source to Earth.
The file IGWN-GWTC3-TGR-v1-liv.tar.gz contains the posterior samples necessary to constrain these parameters. This archive aggregates the results from multiple confident binary black hole (BBH) detections. The methodology for utilizing this data within the IRH framework is as follows:
1. Data Ingestion: The archive contains HDF5 or JSON files with posterior samples for the phenomenological Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) parameters. Specifically, it provides constraints on the effective graviton mass m_g (corresponding to \alpha = 0) and the coefficients for \alpha = 2.5, 3, 4.
2. Reweighting: The standard LVK analysis places bounds on generic LIV. To test IRH specifically, one must re-weight these posteriors. IRH may predict a specific value for \alpha (e.g., \alpha = 3 for certain non-local effective field theories). By extracting the joint posterior on the distance D_L and the chirp mass \mathcal{M}_c from the samples, one can calculate the theoretical de-phasing \Psi_{IRH}(f) predicted by the theory.
3. Constraint Derivation: The absence of significant dispersion in the O3b data—constrained to m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \text{ eV}/c^2—imposes a strict upper limit on the coupling constant A. Any realization of IRH that predicts dispersive effects larger than this bound is empirically ruled out. The computational pipeline must integrate these constraints as a prior penalty in the global fit.
2.3 The Residuals Test: Hunting for Forbidden Modes
One of the most stringent tests for any modified gravity theory is the search for "forbidden" radiation channels. Standard GR predicts that gravitational radiation is purely tensorial (helicity \pm 2). Holographic theories, which often involve additional scalar fields (dilatons) or vector fields coupled to the boundary geometry, predict the emission of scalar (helicity 0) or vector (helicity \pm 1) modes during the violent merger phase.
The archive IGWN-GWTC3-TGR-v1-res.tar.gz provides the definitive dataset for this test. This file contains the coherent residuals—the strain data remaining after the best-fit General Relativity waveform (typically IMRPhenomXPHM or SEOBNRv4PHM) has been subtracted from the detector output.
* Computational Procedure: To verify IRH, the researcher must generate the specific waveform h_{scalar}(t) predicted by the theory's additional degrees of freedom. This waveform is then cross-correlated with the residual data provided in the archive. The detection statistic is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this overlap: where the inner product is weighted by the detector's noise power spectral density (PSD), also included in the archive.
* Interpretation: The LVK analysis indicates that the residuals are consistent with Gaussian noise for all confident events (p-values > 0.05). This null result allows us to place a "coupling limit" on the holographic scalar field. If IRH predicts a scalar breathing mode with an amplitude greater than roughly 1/10th of the tensor mode, it is excluded by this dataset.
2.4 Horizon Structure and Echoes
The "black hole information paradox" motivates many holographic theories to posit that the event horizon is not a featureless point of no return, but a structured membrane—a "fuzzball" or "firewall" situated at the Schwarzschild radius. In IRH, this membrane acts as a resonant cavity. Gravitational waves trapped between the angular momentum barrier of the spacetime and this "hard" holographic surface will reflect back and forth, leaking out as a series of repeating pulses known as echoes.
The file IGWN-GWTC3-TGR-v1-ech.tar.gz contains the results of searches for these post-merger echoes. The LVK analysis utilizes a morphology-independent search based on wavelets and a template-based search using a Lorentzian comb.
* IRH Specificity: While generic echo searches assume a simple repetition, IRH predicts specific phase shifts (e.g., a \pi phase flip at the membrane) and a frequency-dependent reflection coefficient \mathcal{R}(\omega).
* Validation: By accessing the posterior samples for the "echo amplitude" and "time delay" parameters in this archive, one can test the specific IRH prediction. The time delay is expected to be \Delta t_{echo} \approx n M \log(M). If the posteriors are peaked at zero amplitude, the "reflectivity" of the holographic horizon is constrained to be negligible, favoring the classical GR description of a purely absorptive horizon.
3. Numerical Relativity: The Ground Truth and the Nonlinearity Debate
In the high-precision era of gravitational wave astronomy, detecting a deviation from General Relativity is only half the battle. The other half is proving that the deviation is not simply a misunderstood feature of standard, nonlinear GR. This distinction is paramount for IRH, which predicts resonances that might mimic nonlinear interactions. Therefore, a rigorous Numerical Relativity (NR) baseline is required.
3.1 The SXS CCE Waveform Catalog
The Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) collaboration provides the most accurate catalog of binary black hole simulations in existence. For the validation of holographic theories, standard waveforms extracted at a finite radius are insufficient due to gauge ambiguities. The analysis requires waveforms extracted using Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE), which solves the Einstein equations all the way to future null infinity (\mathcal{I}^+).

import sxs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a specific simulation (e.g., SXS:BBH:0123)
# extrapolation_order=2 is a standard choice for stability
waveform = sxs.load("SXS:BBH:0123/Lev/rhOverM", extrapolation_order=2, download=True)

# The waveform object contains the time series and the mode data
time = waveform.t
strain_22 = waveform.data[:, waveform.index(2, 2)]

# Plotting the 'Ground Truth' GR waveform
plt.plot(time, strain_22.real)
plt.title("SXS CCE Waveform (GR Baseline)")
plt.show()

This code snippet demonstrates the retrieval of the rhOverM dataset. For a full analysis, one would iterate over the relevant simulations in the catalog that match the parameters of the LVK events being tested.
3.2 The Nonlinearity vs. Resonance Controversy
A critical challenge in testing IRH is distinguishing intrinsic resonances from Nonlinear Quasinormal Modes (QNMs). Recent studies utilizing the SXS CCE catalog have revealed that the "ringdown" phase of a black hole merger is highly nonlinear. Second-order perturbation theory predicts "quadratic modes" (e.g., a mode at frequency \omega_{quad} \approx 2\omega_{220}) that arise from the self-coupling of the dominant linear mode.
* The Mimicry Problem: An intrinsic holographic resonance might manifest at a frequency very similar to a nonlinear GR mode. For instance, if the holographic entropy bound implies a correction scale \Lambda_{IRH}, it might induce a spectral peak at 1.9 \times f_{ringdown}, which could be easily confused with the 2.0 \times f_{ringdown} quadratic mode of GR.
* Resolution Strategy: The rhOverM files allow researchers to calculate the exact phase and amplitude of the nonlinear modes predicted by GR. By comparing the phase coherence of the observed signal in the LVK data (rin.tar.gz) against the precise phase evolution of the CCE waveform, one can discriminate between the two scenarios. A "quadratic" mode in GR is phase-locked to the square of the primary mode. A holographic resonance, being an excitation of an independent boundary degree of freedom, will likely exhibit a phase drift or a distinct decoherence time.
* The "Agnostic" Approach: The validation framework adopts the "Agnostic Black Hole Spectroscopy" methodology. We fit the ringdown data with a template that allows for generic deviations, and then compare the Bayesian evidence of the IRH hypothesis against the "Nonlinear GR" hypothesis defined by the CCE catalog.
4. Cosmological Expansion: Holographic Dark Energy and Distance Ladders
Intrinsic Resonance Holography predicts that "dark energy" is not a cosmological constant, but a manifestation of the holographic entropy bound scaling with the area of the cosmic horizon. This implies a dynamic equation of state w(z) and a potentially modified distance-redshift relation. Validating this requires precise measurements of the expansion history over cosmic time.
4.1 The Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernova Compilation
The Pantheon+ dataset is the definitive sample for constraining the late-time expansion history. It comprises 1701 light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), covering the redshift range 0.001 < z < 2.3.
Key Data Products:
* Source: GitHub Repository PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease.
* Covariance Matrix: sys_full_long.txt.
* Light Curve Parameters: lcparam_full_long.txt.
The Covariance Matrix (sys_full_long.txt): This file is the linchpin of the cosmological analysis. It is a massive 1701 \times 1701 matrix that encodes the systematic uncertainties affecting the supernova distance measurements. These include calibration errors from the SH0ES Cepheid ladder, dust extinction modeling, peculiar velocity corrections, and selection biases.
* Impact on IRH: A simple \chi^2 analysis using only statistical errors (diagonal elements) would result in artificially tight constraints that could incorrectly rule out IRH. The true likelihood must account for the off-diagonal correlations. The likelihood function is: $$ \chi^2_{IRH} = (\vec{\mu}{obs} - \vec{\mu}{model}(\theta_{IRH}))^T \mathbf{C}^{-1} (\vec{\mu}{obs} - \vec{\mu}{model}(\theta_{IRH})) $$ where \mathbf{C} is the sum of the systematic covariance (sys_full_long.txt) and the statistical covariance (Pantheon+SH0ES_STAT+SYS.cov).
Computational Implementation: The following Python code illustrates how to load this matrix and prepare it for the likelihood calculation within the Cobaya framework. Note the use of numpy for efficient matrix handling.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the systematic covariance matrix
# The file has a header line, so we skip it
cov_sys = np.loadtxt('sys_full_long.txt', skiprows=1)

# Load the statistical covariance (often diagonal or block diagonal)
# Assuming it's in a similar format or provided as a separate file
cov_stat = np.loadtxt('Pantheon+SH0ES_STAT+SYS.cov', skiprows=1)

# The total covariance is the sum
covariance_matrix = cov_sys + cov_stat

# Invert the matrix for the Chi-squared calculation
# Using Cholesky decomposition or standard inversion (pinv for stability)
try:
   inverse_covariance = np.linalg.inv(covariance_matrix)
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
   # Fallback to pseudo-inverse if matrix is singular (common with systematics)
   inverse_covariance = np.linalg.pinv(covariance_matrix)

print(f"Loaded Covariance Matrix Shape: {covariance_matrix.shape}")

4.2 SH0ES and the Hubble Tension
The Pantheon+ compilation is calibrated using the SH0ES (Supernovae, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark energy) project's Cepheid data. This calibration yields a local Hubble constant H_0 \approx 73 km/s/Mpc, which is in tension with the Planck-derived value of \approx 67 km/s/Mpc assuming \LambdaCDM.
* IRH Solution: IRH suggests that the effective energy density of the vacuum "runs" with the scale of the horizon. This scale-dependence could naturally produce a higher local expansion rate compared to the early universe rate.
* Validation Protocol: The validation framework must explicitly include the SH0ES anchor. This is done by including the Cepheid distance moduli (found in the SH0ES_Data folder of the repo) in the likelihood vector. If the IRH model, with its dynamic H(z), can fit both the high-z supernovae and the local Cepheids with a better reduced \chi^2 than \LambdaCDM, it offers a physical resolution to the Hubble tension.
5. Large Scale Structure: Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Growth
To distinguish Intrinsic Resonance Holography from simple "Dark Energy" parameterizations (like w_0 w_aCDM), one must probe the growth of structure. Holographic theories often imply a modification to gravity at large scales—either a screening mechanism or a "leakage" of force into the bulk—which would suppress the clustering of matter.
5.1 DESI Data Release 1 (DR1)
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) provides the most precise measurements of the distribution of galaxies and quasars. The relevant dataset for this analysis is Data Release 1 (DR1).
Data Access:
* URL: https://data.desi.lbl.gov/public/dr1/vac/dr1/full-shape-cosmo-params.
* Structure: The data is organized as a "Value Added Catalog" (VAC) containing Monte Carlo chains and covariance matrices.
Key Files:
1. Chain Files: Files named chain.txt or [prefix].[number].txt. These contain the posterior samples for cosmological parameters such as the matter density \Omega_m, the Hubble constant H_0, and the amplitude of fluctuations \sigma_8.
2. Covariance Matrices: Files named chain.covmat. These capture the correlations between the measured parameters, essential for importance sampling.
5.2 The Full Shape Analysis vs. BAO
While Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) provide a robust geometric ruler to measure the expansion history H(z), they are insensitive to the dynamics of structure formation. To test IRH, we require the Full Shape (FS) analysis.
* The Observable: The Full Shape analysis fits the entire power spectrum P(k) (or correlation function \xi(r)), extracting information about the growth rate of structure, parameterized as f\sigma_8(z).
* IRH Signature: If gravity is holographic, the "bulk" volume available for gravitational collapse is effectively bounded. This should manifest as a suppression of growth (f\sigma_8) at late times compared to the GR prediction, even if the expansion histories are identical.
* Validation with desilike: The DESI collaboration has released a Python package, desilike, designed to interface with these datasets. The computational guide requires installing desilike and using its bindings to Cobaya.
Computational Implementation (Likelihood Setup): The validation pipeline uses desilike to wrap the DESI Full Shape likelihoods.
# Cobaya YAML configuration snippet for DESI
likelihood:
 desilike.likelihoods.baofs.DESIBAOFullShapeLikelihood:
   # Path to the installed or downloaded DESI data
   data_dir: /path/to/desi/dr1/data
   # Specify the tracers (e.g., Luminous Red Galaxies, Emission Line Galaxies)
   tracers:
   # The theory code (e.g., CLASS) will provide P(k)
   stop_at_error: True

By comparing the posterior on f\sigma_8 derived from the DESI chains with the theoretical prediction of IRH, we can calculate the "Growth Tension." A statistically significant preference for lower growth would be a major victory for the holographic framework.
6. Micro-Physics: The Neutrino Mass Connection
Intrinsic Resonance Holography is not limited to macroscopic gravity; it fundamentally reinterprets the vacuum state. Many holographic models posit a "seesaw" mechanism where the smallness of the cosmological constant (\Lambda \approx (2 \text{ meV})^4) is linked to the smallness of the neutrino mass (m_\nu \approx \text{meV}).
6.1 KATRIN Data and Analysis
The KATRIN (Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino) experiment provides the world's most sensitive direct limit on the electron anti-neutrino mass by measuring the kinematics of tritium beta decay.
Data Source:
* Repository: Zenodo Record 13644900.
* Files: KATRIN_data_KNM1-5.json (Measurement Data) and KATRIN_inputs_KNM1-5.json (Model Inputs).
* Format: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
The Analysis: KATRIN measures the integrated \beta-electron spectrum near the kinematic endpoint (E_0 \approx 18.6 keV). A massive neutrino distorts the spectral shape R(E).
* IRH Prediction: IRH may predict a modification to the phase space density of the decay due to the granular or resonant nature of the vacuum. This would appear as a spectral distortion S_{IRH}(E) that differs from the standard massive neutrino signature.
* Computational Protocol: Unlike the internal KATRIN analysis which uses C++ tools like Fitrium , the public release of JSON data allows for a pure Python implementation. The validation pipeline involves parsing the JSON to extract the count rates and experimental response functions, then constructing a custom likelihood.
Python Implementation (JSON Parsing):
import json
import numpy as np

# Load KATRIN data
with open('KATRIN_data_KNM1-5.json', 'r') as f:
   katrin_data = json.load(f)

# Extract relevant fields (Conceptual structure based on standard JSON/Zenodo formats)
# Keys would need to be verified against the specific JSON schema
scan_points = np.array(katrin_data['scan_points']) # Retarding potentials
counts = np.array(katrin_data['counts'])           # Measured electrons
errors = np.array(katrin_data['uncertainties'])    # Statistical errors

print(f"Loaded {len(scan_points)} scan points from KATRIN data.")

This data is then fed into the Cobaya likelihood module, where the theoretical count rate is computed using the IRH-modified beta decay spectrum.
6.2 The Cosmic Microwave Background and Lensing
* Data: Planck 2018 Likelihood (COM_Likelihood_Data-baseline_R3.00.tar.gz) from the Planck Legacy Archive.
* The A_L Anomaly: Planck data prefers a phenomenological lensing amplitude A_L > 1, suggesting more gravitational lensing of the CMB than \LambdaCDM predicts. IRH could resolve this if the holographic medium induces a "blurring" or scattering of photons that mimics lensing.
* Implementation: The Planck likelihood code (clik) is a binary library. Cobaya interfaces with it directly. The user must download the tarball, extract it, and point the clik_path variable in the Cobaya configuration to the extraction directory.
7. The Global Likelihood Framework: Cobaya Implementation
To validat Intrinsic Resonance Holography, one cannot simply test it against one dataset at a time. A "resonance" in the black hole horizon must be consistent with the "resonance" in the dark energy sector. This requires a Global Fit. We utilize Cobaya (Code for Bayesian Analysis), a highly modular Python framework, to synthesize these datasets.
7.1 The Cobaya Architecture
The implementation revolves around a central yaml configuration file that orchestrates the interaction between the Theory Code (solving the IRH equations) and the Likelihoods (the data).
1. The Theory Module (Python Class): The researcher must write a custom Python class inheriting from cobaya.theory.Theory. This class implements the modified physics of IRH.
from cobaya.theory import Theory

class IRH_Theory(Theory):
   def calculate(self, state, want_derived=True, **params_values):
       # Retrieve sampled parameters (e.g., holographic coupling A, alpha)
       A = params_values['A_holographic']
       alpha = params_values['alpha_resonance']

       # 1. Solve modified Friedmann equations for H(z)
       #    This affects Pantheon+ and DESI BAO
       H_z = self.compute_holographic_expansion(A, alpha)

       # 2. Solve modified perturbation equations for f(z) and P(k)
       #    This affects DESI Full Shape
       f_z = self.compute_growth_suppression(A, alpha)

       # 3. Store results in the 'state' dictionary for likelihoods to access
       state['H'] = H_z
       state['growth_rate'] = f_z

2. The Likelihood Integration: The likelihoods defined in previous sections are linked here.
* Planck: Uses the native planck_2018_lowl.TT_clik wrapper.
* Pantheon+: Uses a custom External Likelihood class that reads sys_full_long.txt and computes the \chi^2 using the H(z) provided by IRH_Theory.
* LIGO: The posteriors from liv.tar.gz are used as an Importance Sampling prior. Alternatively, a custom likelihood can be written to interpolate the provided posterior samples.
* KATRIN: A custom likelihood class reads the JSON data and compares it to the beta-spectrum predicted by IRH_Theory.
3. The Sampler: The mcmc sampler is used to explore the high-dimensional parameter space.
sampler:
 mcmc:
   Rminus1_stop: 0.01
   max_tries: 10000
   covmat: auto

7.2 Step-by-Step Computational Guide
1. Environment Setup:
pip install cobaya sxs h5py numpy scipy desilike
cobaya-install cosmo -p /path/to/packages
This installs the core framework, the Numerical Relativity tools (sxs), data handling tools (h5py), and the DESI likelihoods.
2. Data Acquisition:
   * Download COM_Likelihood_Data... (Planck) and extract.
   * Download sys_full_long.txt (Pantheon+) from GitHub.
   * Download liv.tar.gz, res.tar.gz (LIGO) from DCC.
   * Download rhOverM...h5 (SXS) using sxs.load.
   * Download KATRIN_data...json from Zenodo.
   3. Baseline Construction: Run a standard \LambdaCDM chain using Cobaya with the above likelihoods (setting IRH parameters to zero). This establishes the Bayesian Evidence for the Null Hypothesis (Z_{GR}).
   4. IRH Implementation: Code the IRH_Theory class and the custom likelihood wrappers for Pantheon+ and KATRIN.
   5. Global Fit: Run the Cobaya MCMC with the IRH parameters free to vary (e.g., resonance amplitude A, scale \alpha).
   6. Model Comparison: Compute the Bayes Factor B = Z_{IRH} / Z_{GR}. If \ln(B) > 5, the data strongly favors Intrinsic Resonance Holography.
8. Conclusion
The verification of Intrinsic Resonance Holography is a tractable, albeit demanding, computational challenge. It requires moving beyond the comfortable realm of summary statistics and engaging directly with the raw probabilistic outputs of modern experiments. The data required is available: the LIGO TGR archives provide constraints on graviton propagation and horizon structure; the SXS CCE catalog provides the nonlinear GR baseline; Pantheon+ and DESI provide the lever arm on cosmic scales; and Planck and KATRIN anchor the theory in micro-physics.
By synthesizing these datasets within the Cobaya framework, as detailed in this report, researchers can subject IRH to the most rigorous test possible. If the theory is correct, a consistent signal—a "resonance"—will emerge across these diverse physical regimes, solving the Hubble tension, the lensing anomaly, and the information paradox in a single stroke. If not, the precision of these datasets will relegate IRH to the dustbin of theoretical physics, further narrowing the path toward the true theory of quantum gravity. The code and data are ready; the analysis can now begin.
